## Reccomendations
###
Eleven Labs is currently a text-to-speech product. If the company can intergrate Optical Character Recognition, a feature where a photo can be taken of written text, to ultimately be converted to speech, this can assist in an array of ways. For example, medication labels in pharmacies, food lables in grocery stores, notices posted on the street (no parking signs), etc. This can create another form of accessibility for users.

In addition, Eleven Labs is only offering users 32 alternative languages. There are over 7,000 spoken languages in the world. Improving the technology to include a larger magnitude of languages to it's userscan broaden the comapanies overall consumer reach.
